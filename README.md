# OpenSourceLibrary

> Open Source Library is a free online library for everyone to use, 
we want to provide free and stressless access to academic journals and materials for students around the world.  

This version is still building, this is only the skeleton of the front-end, more updates will come later.  

A meme that tells you the current status of this project:
